Title: "Generate Series in SQL"

---

Generating series is something I run sometimes but not frequently enough to warrant memorising it.

# T-SQL

Generating a series can be done using a Tally Table (a brief intro on it can be found [here](https://www.sqlservercentral.com/articles/the-numbers-or-tally-table-what-it-is-and-how-it-replaces-a-loop-1)):

```{sql}
#| eval: false

SELECT TOP 11000 --equates to more than 30 years of dates
        IDENTITY(INT,1,1) AS N
   INTO dbo.Tally
   FROM Master.dbo.SysColumns sc1,
        Master.dbo.SysColumns sc2

```


# DuckDB

```{r}

library(duckdb)

con <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())

```


```{sql, connection = con}

SELECT *
FROM generate_series(DATE '1992-01-01', DATE '1992-03-01', INTERVAL '1' MONTH);

```
